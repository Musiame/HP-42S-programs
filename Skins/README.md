From left to right:

* `HP-42S-X`: realistic HP-42S skin (with the colors of the HP-32SII).
* `42s-X`: rearranged key layout with large numbers for easier entry.
* `ClassicRPN`: skin redesign of the eponymous application by AmeloConsulting (`ClassicRPN` was a great emulator for HP Voyager series but now no longer available on the App Store).
