From left to right:

* `HP-42S-X`: realistic HP-42S skin (but with the colors of the HP-32SII).
* `42s-X`: rearranged key layout with large numbers for easier entry.
* `ClassicRPN`: recreation of the skin design of the eponymous App by AmeloConsulting (`ClassicRPN` was a great emulator for HP Voyager series but itâ€™s no longer available on the App Store).
